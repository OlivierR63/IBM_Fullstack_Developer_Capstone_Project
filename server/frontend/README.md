# Frontend Application (React)

This directory contains the source code, configuration, and build artifacts for the single-page application (SPA) that provides the user interface for the dealership application. It is built using **React** and is deployed as a static application via Docker.

## 1. Directory Structure Overview

The frontend follows a typical React project structure, with a separation between source files, build outputs, and third-party dependencies.


frontend/

??? build/             # ?? Output of the production build

??? node_modules/      # ?? Third-party libraries (Dependencies)

??? public/            # ?? Static assets (HTML template, Favicon)

??? src/               # Core application source code

?   ??? components/    # Reusable UI components

?   ??? images/        # Application-wide image assets

?   ??? App.js         # Main application component

?   ??? index.js       # Entry point for React rendering

?   ??? App.css        # Global application styles

??? static/            # Legacy files (Relics from initial version)

??? Dockerfile         # Docker instructions for building and serving the app

??? package.json       # Project configuration and dependencies

??? package-lock.json  # Locked dependency versions




## 2. Key Files and Configuration

| File | Role | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `package.json` | **Configuration** | Lists all development and production dependencies (`react`, `axios`, etc.) and defines build scripts (`start`, `build`). |
| `Dockerfile` | **Deployment** | Contains the steps to build the React application and serve the resulting static files using a minimal server (e.g., Nginx or a lightweight Node server). |
| `App.js` | **Routing** | Defines the main structure and routing logic for the entire SPA, linking different components like `Home` and `Dealer Details`. |
| `index.js` | **Entry Point** | The initial JavaScript file executed by the browser; responsible for mounting the root `App.js` component to the HTML DOM. |

## 3. Detailed Directory Breakdown

### `src/` (Source Code)

This is the main development workspace containing all the logic and rendering components.

| Directory / File | Role | Contents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/components/` | **UI Components** | Contains the core logic for the graphical interface: `About`, `Contact`, `Dealers`, `Header`, `Home`, `Login`, and `Register`. |
| `src/components/assets/` | **Styles & Graphics** | Stores static resources directly related to components, including global styles (`style.css`) and third-party stylesheets (`bootstrap.min.css`). |
| `src/images/` | **Image Pool** | Holds various graphical files used throughout the user interface. |
| `src/App.css` | **Global Styles** | Contains CSS rules applied globally to the application. |

### `build/` (Build Output)

This directory is generated when the application is compiled for production (using `npm run build`).

* **Origin:** Created by the React build tool (e.g., Vite or Create React App).
* **Role:** Contains the final **minified and optimized static assets** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript bundles) ready for deployment. This is the content served by the Docker container.

### `node_modules/` (Dependencies)

This directory stores all the code for the third-party libraries listed in `package.json`.

* **Origin:** Generated by the `npm install` command.
* **Role:** Essential for running the application, as it contains React, React Router, Axios, and all other necessary tools and libraries. This directory is typically very large and ignored in version control (`.gitignore`).

### `public/` (Static Assets)

This directory holds files that are copied directly into the `build/` folder without being processed by the build pipeline.

* **Origin:** Defined in the project setup (e.g., `public/index.html` is the main template).
* **Role:** Contains the main HTML file (`index.html`) used as the template for the SPA, as well as static files like the application favicon.

### `static/` (Legacy Relics)

This directory contains files that are no longer actively used by the React application.

* **Origin:** Leftover files from the application's initial, non-React version (e.g., raw HTML files defining the interface).
* **Role:** **Relic/Historical** — These files are not part of the current production workflow and should be considered deprecated.
