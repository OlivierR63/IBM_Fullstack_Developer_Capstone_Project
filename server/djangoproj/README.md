# Django Project Configuration (`djangoproj/`)

This directory serves as the **central configuration hub** for the entire Django project. While `djangoapp` contains the application logic, `djangoproj` defines how the project is configured, how it handles requests, and how it interfaces with web servers.

## 1. Directory Overview

This directory contains the essential Python files generated by the `django-admin startproject` command, customized to support the multi-service architecture of this application.

| File | Purpose | Key Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `settings.py` | **Global Settings** | Core configuration: Database, Auth, Middleware, Static files, and CORS. |
| `urls.py` | **Root URL Dispatcher** | Entry point for URL routing; delegates to `djangoapp` and serves the UI. |
| `wsgi.py` | **Sync Web Interface** | Interface for synchronous web servers (e.g., Gunicorn). |
| `asgi.py` | **Async Web Interface** | Interface for asynchronous web servers (e.g., Daphne, Uvicorn). |

## 2. Detailed File Analysis

### `settings.py` (Core Configuration)
This is the most critical file for the backend's behavior. Based on the analysis, it has been customized for a **Dockerized environment**:

* **Security & Access**: Uses `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` for development flexibility in Docker and includes `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to permit communication with the React frontend on port `3000`.
* **Application Registry**: Connects the `djangoapp` and third-party libraries like `corsheaders`.
* **Static Assets**: Configures `STATICFILES_DIRS` to point to the frontend's build and static folders, allowing Django to serve the React production build.
* **Middleware**: Orchestrates security, sessions, and CSRF protection (notably using `Lax` SameSite cookies).

### `urls.py` (Root Routing)
This file acts as the **Main Switchboard** for the server. It uses a structured approach:
1.  **Admin Route**: Links to the default `/admin/` dashboard.
2.  **Logic Route**: Includes all business logic endpoints from `djangoapp.urls` under the `/djangoapp/` prefix.
3.  **Static Serving**: Appends static file patterns to serve images and CSS during development.

### `wsgi.py` & `asgi.py` (Server Interfaces)
These files define how the application communicates with the web server software:
* **`wsgi.py` (Web Server Gateway Interface)**: The standard for synchronous Python applications. It exposes the `application` object used by production servers.
* **`asgi.py` (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)**: The modern successor to WSGI, allowing the project to handle asynchronous features if needed in the future (like WebSockets or Long Polling).

## 3. Integration Role

The `djangoproj` directory ensures that the **Backend (Django)** can correctly identify the **Frontend (React)** assets and communicate securely with the **Microservices** by managing environment-wide variables and cross-origin policies.
